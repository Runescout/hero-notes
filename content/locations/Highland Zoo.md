**The Highland Zoo** is one of the most renowned animal care, genetic research, and conservation centers in the postwar world, located in the verdant northern arc of Newels City. Sprawling across 400 biodiverse acres—once a derelict military preserve—the zoo serves as both sanctuary and scientific frontier. Founded in 2022 by naturalist and bioethics pioneer **Julianna Verne**, the Highland Zoo began as a humble refuge for displaced species during the chaos of the First Collapse. Today, it is credited with some of the most miraculous achievements in post-extinction bio-restoration.

Among its crowning accomplishments is the **Verne Protocol**, a classified genetic resurrection technique responsible for the revival of a dozen species, including the snow-coated Eastern Mountain Lion, the Gulf Cormorant, and the flame-spotted River Lynx. While the specifics of the process remain tightly guarded, the Zoo’s research division is known to use a hybrid of preserved DNA, synthetic gestation environments, and micro-adaptive AI to stabilize traits over multiple generations. Despite growing pressure from biotech corporations and foreign governments, the Highland Zoo has refused to patent the technology—citing fears of ecological exploitation, weaponization, and uncontrolled cloning.

Visitors to the zoo experience more than just traditional enclosures: the habitats are fully immersive biomes, some with altered atmospheric conditions, others with augmented reality overlays designed to educate and engage. Education and ethics are core to the mission—every tour, exhibit, and lecture stresses coexistence over control. The Zoo also trains conservation diplomats, known as [[Wild Keepers]], who work across faction borders to protect habitats and intervene during ecological crises.
