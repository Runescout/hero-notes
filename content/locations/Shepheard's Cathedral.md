**The Shepherd’s Cathedral** stands as the spiritual and political epicenter of the Holy Republic of Appalachia—a monolithic structure of blackened stone and burnished iron, its spires clawing at the sky like fingers in prayer. Completed in 2081 amid the chaos of the civil conflict, the Cathedral was built to endure, to dominate the skyline, and to remind every citizen that faith is the unshakable cornerstone of the Republic’s identity. It serves not only as the grandest house of worship in the region but as the seat of the **Council of Ordained Stewards**, a powerful theocratic body that governs the Republic through scripture, vision, and divine mandate.

Inside, the Cathedral’s vast interior is lit by flickering braziers and stained-glass windows that cast crimson and gold light across a sea of kneeling worshippers. At its center burns the **Heartflame**, a massive, eternal lantern suspended above the pulpit, said to represent the guiding presence of the Shepherd Himself. Services are thunderous and immersive—part sermon, part spectacle—blending scripture with solemn oaths, military hymns, and prophetic declarations. The faithful are taught that the war was not merely political but spiritual: a test, a refining fire that forged the Republic into a vessel for divine purpose.

Beyond its sacred halls, the Cathedral’s reach is vast. Its doctrine shapes policy, education, and even scientific inquiry within Appalachia. Missionaries and cultural envoys are dispatched regularly to frontier towns and borderlands, bearing both aid and the Word. Though respected by some and feared by others in the broader continental community, few question the influence of the Shepherd’s Cathedral.
