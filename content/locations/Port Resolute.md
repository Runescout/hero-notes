A century after the Second Founding, **Newels City** stands as the continent’s busiest crossroads—a sprawling urban colossus where the edges of all five nations blur into a single pulse. At its heart lies the vast and relentless engine of commerce: **Port Resolute**, officially named in honor of the peace it was built to protect, though locals still call it simply _East Side Port_. Stretching for miles along the jagged eastern waterfront, the port is a brutal harmony of towering cranes, floating markets, modular docking bays, and rusted cargo megastructures. Ships of every flag—from Cascadian algae-haulers to PPC smart-freighters—dock side by side, while Red River longshoremen, Dominion logistics officers, and Appalachian barter guilds work shoulder to shoulder under the glare of floodlights and ever-watching drones. Above it all, the skyline flickers with multilingual neon, and the city’s signature tramline snakes along the docks like a steel serpent.
