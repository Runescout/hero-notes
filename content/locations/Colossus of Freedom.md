Erected in the wake of [[The Second Founding]], the **Colossus of Freedom** stands as the tallest monument on the eastern seaboard, a testament to the hard-fought unification of the five successor nations. Towering above Liberty Bay, the Colossus is faceless—its helm a polished alloy mirror that reflects the people back to themselves, a reminder that freedom is shaped by those who bear its weight. Forged from reclaimed war materials and consecrated jointly by leaders from each faction, the monument holds aloft a blazing torch —a symbol of vigilance and shared hope. Its other hand grips a broken chain, honoring the struggle to break free from tyranny, division, and the old world’s failures. Inscribed into the stone at its base are five creeds—one from each nation—acknowledging their differences, but bound by a pact to never again let the continent fall to war.
