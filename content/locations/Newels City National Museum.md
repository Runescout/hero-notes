**The Newels City National Museum** is the cultural heart of the postwar continent—a vast, multi-tiered complex of memory, myth, and meticulously curated truth. Nestled at the intersection of all five factional districts in the city’s central convergence zone, the Museum stands as both a beacon and battleground of collective identity. First opened in 2097, on the 50th anniversary of the Second Founding, the institution was envisioned as a neutral ground where the histories, traumas, triumphs, and ideologies of the fractured nations could be preserved and displayed without erasure or revisionism.

The Museum itself is an architectural marvel: a fusion of Cascadian organic design, Dominion dataglass frameworks, and Red River steelwork—a physical metaphor for the continent’s uneasy unity. Its ten main wings cover a staggering range of themes, including _Pre-War America_, _The Fracture Years_, _The Six-Year Conflict_, _The Second Founding_, and _The Post-National Era_. Permanent exhibits include interactive war map holograms, firsthand AI-narrated soldier testimonies, and restored artifacts from the early Unification Councils, including the original plasma torch prototype used in the Colossus of Freedom.

One of its most controversial sections, the **Room of Divergent Truths**, features rotating faction-specific accounts of the civil war years, displayed side by side without editorial intervention—allowing visitors to confront contradiction and bias head-on. In the **Gallery of Echoes**, augmented soundscapes pull oral histories from different backgrounds into a single immersive experience, while the **Children’s Hall of Kinship** uses games and virtual reality to teach a new generation about what was lost—and what might be preserved.

The Museum is also home to the **National Archive of Reconciliation**, a secure subterranean chamber where personal records, genetic legacies, and diplomatic artifacts are stored under joint custodianship by all five governments. Though often a site of political tension and symbolic protest, the Newels City National Museum remains a sacred space in a divided world: a place where memory is not only protected but interrogated, and where the fragile thread of unity is held taut by the shared act of remembering.
