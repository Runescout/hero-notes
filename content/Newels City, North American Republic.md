**Newels City** stands as the grandest monument to peace in a world that once tore itself apart. Built atop the ashen remains of what was once a capital, the city rose from the shattered bones of old-world Washington D.C., its foundations laid not by a single victor, but by a coalition of former enemies. Six years after [[The Second Founding]], the five newly sovereign nations—bitter rivals only a decade before—undertook the construction of a unified city-state that would serve as neutral ground, shared heritage, and symbol of a second chance. The project, called the **Newels Accord**, took twelve years to complete, with each faction contributing engineers, architects, and philosophy to its design.

Newels City is structured with intentional symmetry and balance—five cardinal districts, each representing one of the founding nations, converge around a central civic ring known as the **Axis of Concord**. This hub houses the **Continental Assembly**, the **Judicial Forum**, and the headquarters of several inter-factional bodies, including the UN's relocated command. The architecture is a masterclass in compromise: brutalist towers from the Dominion stand beside the biotextile domes of the Pacific Collective, all woven together with the art-deco flourish favored by the River States and the reclaimed steel-and-stone austerity of Appalachian construction. The Harmony Trust, a technocratic guild rooted in the Industrial Compact, oversees maintenance of the city's shared infrastructure—power grids, transit systems, and neural networks.

Life in Newels is a complex but functional equilibrium. Citizens from all five nations are free to live and work within the city’s bounds, though each district maintains its own language norms, food traditions, and cultural touchstones. The **Unity Park** greenbelt threads through all five territories like a living artery, while the East Side Port (officially known as [[Port Resolute]]) feeds the city’s hunger for trade and exchange. Yet beneath the surface of cross-cultural cooperation lies a constant negotiation—of influence, ideology, and historical memory. The peace holds, but only because the city itself is designed to keep the balance from tipping too far in any one direction.

Despite its political core, Newels has become a cultural powerhouse. Institutions like the **[[Newels City National Museum]]**, **[[Verne College of Applied Technology]]**, and the controversial **[[Highland Zoo]]** draw artists, scientists, and thinkers from across the continent. Nightlife thrives in the intersecting margins between districts—where fusion cuisine, rogue theater, and techno-spiritual movements blur the boundaries of factional identity. Establishments like **[[The Jungle Pit]]**, a four-star restaurant and underground club, exemplify the city’s dual nature: decorum above, electricity below. Even in the face of lingering tensions, Newels has become a beacon for a generation born after the war, who seek not to rebuild what was lost, but to create what never was.

The city is not without its secrets. Rumors persist of old bunkers hidden beneath the Axis, vaults sealed during the Fracture that no faction has dared to unearth. Some whisper that remnants of prewar experiments—biological, technological, even ideological—still pulse in the dark places beneath Unity Park or beneath the marble of the Judicial Forum. While officially denied, these stories persist, stoked by cryptic symbols occasionally found in the city’s older districts and the eerie precision of its original design. To many, Newels is more than a city—it is a system, a machine built to manage the fragile peace, and possibly, to survive the next fall.

One hundred years after the end of the war, Newels City remains the single most ambitious project of the Second Founding. It is a place where ghosts of the past walk beside the architects of the future, where the ruins of empire lie beneath skyways of progress. It is both sanctuary and staging ground, a perpetual question posed in steel and stone: Can peace be permanent? Or is the city, like those who built it, merely holding its breath between storms?
