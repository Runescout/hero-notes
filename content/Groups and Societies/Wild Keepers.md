**The Wild keepers** are an elite, continent-spanning corps of conservation diplomats, field biologists, and conflict mediators trained and commissioned through the Highland Zoo’s Institute for Post-Species Stewardship. Formed in the turbulent decades following the Second Founding, the Wild keepers arose out of necessity—tasked with protecting endangered ecosystems, rewilding former war zones, and navigating the delicate intersection of sovereignty, survival, and environmental collapse. Each Wild keeper is cross-trained in advanced ecology, xenogenetics, paramilitary survival, and factional law, allowing them to operate in politically unstable regions where traditional governance often fails.

Unlike most international operatives, Wild keepers are granted neutral status under the Accord of Living Systems, recognized by all five successor nations and even most rogue states. Their emblem—a broken chain encircled by a living vine—is both a symbol of continuity and quiet warning. They travel light, often alone or in pairs, carrying encrypted data seeds, nonlethal deterrents, and personal archives of biome histories. Tales of their exploits range from mythic to tragic: relocating a reborn predator species across hostile borders, negotiating with armed settlers to preserve a dying wetland, or escorting ancient seed vaults out of collapsing domes. Revered by some and mistrusted by others, the Wild keepers are more than conservationists—they are living reminders that peace with the natural world is never permanent, only earned.
