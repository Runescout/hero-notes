The **Continental Assembly** is the central legislative body of The North American Republic. Formed as part of the peace accords, it was designed to reflect the political and cultural diversity of the five nations. A wide range of factions hold seats, from traditionalist religious parties to forward-thinking technocrats. Coalitions shift regularly, with alliances forming around issues rather than ideology. Debate is frequent, passionate, and often unpredictable. No single group holds lasting control, which forces compromise and makes every decision a matter of negotiation.

Scientific and technological parties hold a significant presence in the chamber. Their role is not just advisoryâ€”they actively shape law and long-term policy. These factions emphasize data, predictive modeling, and measured progress. They often act as a stabilizing force, urging caution in ideological disputes and offering solutions rooted in research. While some members see them as overly clinical, others view them as essential to keeping the Assembly grounded. Their influence has helped prevent major legislative collapse and guided the city through several potential crises.
