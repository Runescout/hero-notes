The Wars of the Second Founding were not a single, decisive civil war, but rather a cascade of revolts, regional collapses, and ideological fractures that brought an already fractured nation to its final breaking point. Lasting six years, this conflict obliterated what remained of the old federal government. The fighting claimed tens of millions of lives and transformed the map of the continent permanently. By the war’s end, five new sovereign powers had emerged, each with their own philosophy, structure, and vision for the future. The world they inherited was in ruins, but from those ruins rose a new and uneasy peace—a Second Founding.

The **Dominion of Columbia** was the first to take form, born from remnants of the old military-industrial complex, corporate syndicates, and former federal security agencies. Its heartland stretched from the Mid-Atlantic to the old Great Lakes region. When the federal chain of command collapsed, defense contractors and infrastructure magnates stepped into the power vacuum. They framed their rise as a restoration of order, branding the Dominion as humanity’s shield against chaos. Under a strict civic code and vertically integrated economy, they reasserted control over key energy and transportation corridors. To its citizens, the Dominion promised stability through strength and a future engineered, not improvised.

Not long after, the **Holy Republic of Appalachia** coalesced from a patchwork of spiritual movements, agrarian militias, and local theocratic councils. Centered in the Appalachian highlands, its ideology blended evangelical revivalism with a doctrine of purification, calling for a retreat from the corruptions of prewar decadence. The Flame Doctrine unified its communities under a divine mission—to protect the soul of civilization through isolation, moral rigor, and self-reliance. Though it did not seek conquest, the Holy Republic fought with zealous determination when threatened. Its society became centered around churches, self-sufficient communes, and sacred tradition. The Shepheard’s Cathedral became its towering symbol of unity and authority.

Farther west, the **Free Confederation of Cascadia** formed from a coalition of city-states, eco-technological communes, and breakaway national guard units in the Pacific Northwest. As the old order crumbled, Cascadia’s citizens rejected both centralized rule and reactionary ideology. What emerged instead was a loosely bound confederation of cooperative polities—governed through rotating councils, mutual aid agreements, and advanced ecological policy. Cascadia’s strength was not in numbers or weapons, but in mobility, adaptability, and control over key communication networks. Though often misunderstood as anarchic, its internal harmony came from a shared belief in decentralized sovereignty and environmental interdependence.

The **Red River Directorate** arose in the Mississippi River Basin from a coalition of agricultural unions, civic engineers, and local administrators who banded together to preserve essential infrastructure and human dignity as the old nation collapsed. Their society was forged through collective necessity, guided by the belief that land and people are inseparable—a truth reflected in their enduring motto: _“One Soil, One People.”_ Unlike rigid technocracies, the Directorate operates through interconnected regional councils and communal boards, prioritizing cooperation, self-sufficiency, and mutual duty. Loyalty to one another and to the land is considered sacred, and individual ambition is subordinated to the needs of the whole. In a world fractured by ideology and ego, the Directorate offers something simpler and stronger: unity rooted in shared labor and a deep reverence for the soil.

Finally, on the far coast, the **Pacific Prosperity Collective** solidified its grip over much of California and the western seaboard. Originally formed from a coalition of climate research enclaves, biotech firms, and secessionist municipalities, the Collective advocated for radical autonomy, scientific progress, and post-national governance. Rather than fight in conventional campaigns, it disrupted the war through cyberwarfare, strategic sabotage, and diplomatic manipulation. Its governing model became a patchwork of semi-autonomous research zones and experimental social contracts. Though critics called it unstable or even cult-like, the Collective maintained internal cohesion through a shared commitment to progress and personal freedom—balanced by quiet but firm central oversight.

By 2089, the old United States was gone. Its capital reduced to irradiated rubble. A ceasefire known as the **Accord of Stillwater** was brokered through weeks of delicate negotiation in a neutral zone between the warring factions. The most ambitious outcome of that accord was the plan to build **Newels City**, a shared continental capital constructed on the ruins of D.C. and completed six years later. No single faction would govern Newels. Instead, it would be administered collectively, housing the **Continental Assembly** and serving as the neutral ground where diplomacy could replace warfare.

The scars of the Second Founding have never fully healed, but the act of shared creation—of building a new world together from the ruins of the old—remains one of the few binding myths of the postwar era. A hundred years later, those founding ideals still echo through the politics, alliances, and quiet tensions of the world that followed.
